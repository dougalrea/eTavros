# eTavros - The virtual cryptocurrency trading platform

## Overview 

eTavros is an online cryptocurrency trading platform I built on a Python/Django back end with a React front end. Similar to eToro™ (but arguably better) it allows users to:

- view and interact with realtime candlestick charts, 
- buy and sell a variety of cryptocurrencies with virtual money, 
- track the rise and fall of their portfolio value, 
- view the trade history of each coin & witness third party trades as they happen,
- interpret & contribute to live market sentiment with coin-favouriting and Bullish/Bearish commenting functionality.

Etavros juggles multiple live websocket data streams with first and third party api requests, a range of third party libraries, interactive trading chart generation and fool proof error handling all under the sleek hood of a single page application. Seriously, you should go check it out.

## Brief

### Project Brief

- Build a full-stack application by making your own backend and your own front-end.
- Use a Python Django API using Django REST Framework to serve your data from a Postgres database.
- Consume your API with a separate front-end built with React.
- Be a complete product which most likely means multiple relationships and CRUD functionality for at least a couple of models.
- Implement thoughtful user stories/wireframes that are significant enough to help you know which features are core MVP and which you can cut.
- Have a visually impressive design to kick your portfolio up a notch and have something to wow future clients & employers.
- Be deployed online so it’s publicly accessible.
